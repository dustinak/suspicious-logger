Running
=======

This script is a small set of modifications to Google's generated example app.

If you need a set of GeoIP data files, or to update them:

    GeoIP_data/update.sh

Example invokations.

List all logins from an IP:

    ./SuspiciousLogger.py --actorIpAddress 131.252.132.33 --applicationName login list

List all logins for a User:

    ./SuspiciousLogger.py --userKey maxp@pdx.edu --applicationName login list

NOTE: This API is *near* real-time but inexplicably lags behind email notices of
"suspicious logins" by days, weeks or even months. THANKS GOOGLE.

Installation
============

The full source for the google-api-python-client library is included
in this starter application, but the library has not been installed on your
system. That means that this sample will run from within the unzipped
directory, but from nowhere else.

The easiest way to install the client library into your system is by running easy_install:

  easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client

You might need to add a 'sudo' to the beginning of that command depending on your platform.
If you don't have easy_install you can get it by installing the setuptools package.


Documentation
=============

The documentation for the google-api-python-client library is avialable here:
